## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

When it comes to units to be used for font-size, margin, padding, I'm still not a 100% sure which is the best way. I have read various blogs and articles and I have an understanding of how each unit(px, em, rem, etc) works but it seems like there's no one right way.
